I also have a team of web and mobile app developers. We do freelance web and mobile app development.

I have 10 years of professional developer experience. 
My primary skills for the backend are mainly Laravel, PHP, and MySQL, for which I have 10 years of experience.
I also used Postgres and MongoDB databases in my projects. 
I am proficient in creating REST APIs, writing tests, and TDD or Test Driven Development.
I am also well-experienced in SOLID principles, Domain-driven Design, and Clean Architecture.
I am also knowledgeable in Nodejs and Typescript.

In frontend, I have 6 years of experience in Vuejs. 
I am proficient in both version 2 and version 3 with Typescript.
